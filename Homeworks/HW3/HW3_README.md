## Introduction

This program is meant to implement a Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Scikit-learn's Dummy Classifier models to solve a classification problem in the form of non-linearly separable dataset, comparing their performances (by accuracies and macro F1 scores) in analyzing training datasets and predicting upon development and testing datasets.

## Prerequisites

This program utilizes the following datasets:
- `wine.data`: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine

This program utilizes the following libraries:
- `numpy`: https://numpy.org/install/
- `pandas`: https://pandas.pydata.org/
- `matplotlib`: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html
- `sklearn`: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
- `collections`: Included with Python

## Usage

This program can be run from the Command Prompt/Terminal with the following command:

    python3 HW3.py

***NOTE:*** The prerequisite dataset files must be located in the same folder as the program. Otherwise, their filepaths may need to be updated within the program's source code to reflect their actual locations.
