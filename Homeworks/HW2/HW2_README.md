## Introduction

This program is meant to implement a Perceptron, Adaline, and baseline model to a variety of linearly- and non-linearly separable datasets, comparing their performance and accuracy in analyzing training datasets and predicting upon testing datasets.

## Prerequisites

This program utilizes the following datasets:
- `LinSep.csv`: Included
- `NonLinSep.csv`: Included
- `train.csv`: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

This program utilizes the following libraries:
- `numpy`: https://numpy.org/install/
- `pandas`: https://pandas.pydata.org/
- `matplotlib`: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html
- `sklearn`: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html

## Usage

This program can be run from the Command Prompt/Terminal with the following command:

    python3 HW2.py

***NOTE:*** The prerequisite dataset files must be located in the same folder as the program. Otherwise, their filepaths may need to be updated within the program's source code to reflect their actual locations.
