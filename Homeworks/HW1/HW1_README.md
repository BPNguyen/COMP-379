## Introduction 

This program is meant to create an algorithm that predicts whether or not a passenger survived on the Titanic based on their demographic and manifest features, analyzing both a training dataset for accuracy and predicting upon a testing dataset.

## Prerequisites

This program utilizes the `train.csv` and `test.csv` datasets, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

Additionally, this program utilizes the `pandas` library, in which more information can be found at https://pandas.pydata.org/.

## Usage

This program can be run from the Command Prompt/Terminal with the following command:

    python3 HW1.py

***NOTE:*** The `train.csv` and `test.csv` dataset files must be located in the same folder as `HW1.py`. Otherwise, their filepaths may need to be updated within `HW1.py` to reflect their actual locations.
